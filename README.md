# Modeling and Simulation

**Modeling and Simulation - Pemodelan dan Simulasi** | In this course, students learn concept & procedure in creating simulation model of a real system which the performance efficiency is under study, run a simulation model, draw conclusion on efficiency based on the analysis of simulation output, develop alternative system and compare performance based on the output of simulation run and the output of the real system, able to work individually and in a group.
